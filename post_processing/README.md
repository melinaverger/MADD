Make sure you already set up the project on your computer by following the instructions of the [first section of the previous README](../README.md#1-set-up-the-project-on-your-computer).

Thus, once you had changed your working directory and activated the virtual environment, you can do the following:

(1) Install, with this command line, the needed kernel for using the jupyter notebook of this folder:
```
$ ipython kernel install --user --name=env
```

(2) Open the jupyter notebook:
```
$ jupyter notebook ./post_processing/experiments.ipynb
```
